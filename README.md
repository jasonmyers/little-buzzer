# Problem

On Operations teams, Engineers are responsible for the performance of
a software application. Performance encompasses everything from bare
metal, up to and including the software itself. There are many tools
that monitor performance and unlimited data points that can be
collected. However, once you decide on the data points that are
critical to you, how do you notify your team when something goes
wrong?

This is the problem that Little Buzzer solves. Little Buzzer
aggregates performance data from 3rd party monitoring solutions and
allows you to notify the right people on your team at the right
times. You can set escalation workflows that notify different people
with different communication methods such as SMS, phone, or email.
